# Born to Code

We developed this responsive E-Commerce site to sell coding themed merchandise.
It was a fantastic experience working together, and we acquired valuable experience working as a team on a software project from the ground up.

## Screenshots
Not sure how many we'd want to do. In the past, I've done Home Page, and then a screenshot of each of the important pages.
